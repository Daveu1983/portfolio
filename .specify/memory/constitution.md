# Portfolio Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Client-Side & Stateless
The website is a static portfolio, designed to be deployed without a backend or database. It MUST NOT collect, store, or process any user or visitor information. All functionality must be implemented and executed entirely on the client-side.

## Governance

This constitution guides the development of the portfolio website. Any changes to the site's architecture or functionality must adhere to the core principle of being client-side and stateless. Amendments to this constitution require updating this document.
